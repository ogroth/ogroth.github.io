<p>I am a PhD student at Oxford University supervised by <a href="https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/ingmar-posner/">Prof. Ingmar Posner</a> at the <a href="https://ori.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI)</a> and <a href="www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi">Prof. Andrea Vedaldi</a> at the <a href="www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/">Visual Geometry Group (VGG)</a>.
My <a href="/research">research</a> focuses on the acquisition of physical intution and its utilization in robot learning.
In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-XUeHmX--k">TEDx talk</a>, I give an overview of what motivates my research and how it could be applied to teach a robot playing Jenga.</p>

<p>Previously, I obtained a Diplom degree in Computer Science from Dresden University of Technology where I worked on grounding of natural language in images supervised by <a href="https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/carsten-rother/">Prof. Carsten Rother</a>.
During my time as a visiting student researcher at the <a href="http://svl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Vision Lab</a> supervised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li">Prof. Fei-Fei Li</a>, I was also involved in the <a href="https://visualgenome.org/">VisualGenome project</a>.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy long walks and hikes, listening to music and playing the piano.
I am also very passionate about playing computer and tabletop games - a passion which, over time, has also grown into making them myself as a member of an indie developer team called <a href="https://phoenixtales.de/">PhoenixTales</a>.</p>
