I am a PhD student at Oxford University supervised by [Prof. Ingmar Posner](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/ingmar-posner/) at the [Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI)](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/) and [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi) at the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/).
My [research](/research) focuses on the acquisition of physical intution and its utilization in robot learning.
In this [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-XUeHmX--k), I give an overview of what motivates my research and how it could be applied to teach a robot playing Jenga.

Previously, I obtained a Diplom degree in Computer Science from Dresden University of Technology where I worked on grounding of natural language in images supervised by [Prof. Carsten Rother](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/people/carsten-rother/).
During my time as a visiting student researcher at the [Stanford Vision Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/) supervised by [Prof. Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li), I was also involved in the [VisualGenome project](https://visualgenome.org/).

In my spare time, I enjoy long walks and hikes, listening to music and playing the piano.
I am also very passionate about playing computer and tabletop games - a passion which, over time, has also grown into making them myself as a member of an indie developer team called [PhoenixTales](https://phoenixtales.de/).
